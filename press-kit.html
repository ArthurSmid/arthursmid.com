  <h2>Advance Praise for <cite class="italic">You Will Win The Future</cite></h2>
  </div>
  <p>"Like the best speculative fiction, Arthur Smid's <cite class="italic">You Will Win The Future</cite> had me vacillating between feeling that the world described was quite familiar and then trying to reassure myself that it was a preposterous exaggeration. If this isn't our world, quite, it certainly shines a light on and amplifies our world's tendencies. I traveled along with these sincere, questioning characters and found myself so suspicious and fearful—yet ultimately hopeful that there may still be people who can use technology's inhuman tools to return us to a more human state." —<span class="bold">Peter Rock</span>, author of <cite class="italic">My Abandonment</cite>, adapted into the award-winning movie <cite class="italic">Leave No Trace</cite></p>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  </div>
  <p>ENTERING THE FINAL FRONTIER of economic mobility, Shane scores a job in tech. They merge a massively multi-player online video game with an investment fund to buy up property after the Cascadia earthquake. The founders are betting on disaster and as Shane gets exposed to the sociopaths inside the company, he begins to passively rebel—but he’s very reluctant to quit. After years of being unable to leverage an indie game he made into a real business, this is his chance to learn. It’s an opportunity to move out of his folks’ house, and his partner does truly need the company health plan. Wealth is their only protection in 21st century America. And yet Shane would rather help create a platform for digital work with real benefits, social solidarity and mutual aid. When the Terms of Service are a new constitution: <cite class="italic">can humankind survive the future?</cite></p>

Arthur does outreach and community support for nonprofits, managing social media for Bear Trust International and contributing to a local chapter of Code for America.<br>
     <br>He grew up in Eugene and graduated from the University of Oregon in 1996, moving to Portland in 2000.
