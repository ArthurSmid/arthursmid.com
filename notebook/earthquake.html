      <h2>EARTHQUAKE!</h2>
      <img src="../images/game-board.jpg" class="full-screen" alt="EARTHQUAKE! A board game, by Arthur Smid">
      <br>
      <h3>Players 2 - 8</h3>
      <h3>For ages 10+</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="pages">Before the catastrophic quake, you and your friends must reinforce the tank farm that stores the hazardous liquids of city life. Play with or against each other to built structures large enough to reach the tanks. You can build, steal, invest, and profit, but the site has to be secured from at least three sides or you all will suffer the world’s single largest environmental disaster! The earthquake is a natural hazard, inevitable, and survivable—the choices you make in building the city determine whether the quake results in disaster.<br>
      <br><h3><b class="bold-font">About the pieces and game board</b></h3><br>
      <p>In the box, you receive everything needed to decide the fate of your city.<br>
      <br>
      Player pieces<br>
      Building pieces<br>
      Game board<br>
      Deeds<br>
      Dice<br>
      <br><p>
      The player character pieces are eight geometric solids, made of wood, painted red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, black, and white. Each player starts with the same amount of building material, different colors and configurations of half-inch squares:<br>
      <br>
      Blue - a single square<br>
      Red - a corner made of three squares<br>
      Orange - a line of two squares<br>
      Yellow - a line of three squares<br>
      Green - a line of three squares with one attached in the center<br>
      <br><p>
      To prepare for the future, you have equal powers. These building pieces are your store of value, your medium of exchange, units of accounts. The pieces are a solid color and each has one side striped with thin grooved lines. All players begin with:<br>
      <br>
      5 blue<br>
      4 red<br>
      3 orange<br>
      2 yellow<br>
      1 green<br>
      <br>
      If you want, imagine them to be the basic materials of construction: wood, concrete, steel, glass, and copper. Better yet, the critical lifelines that go to any urban structure: water and wastewater, electricity, fuel, transportations, and communications. Reinforce the built environment. Your structure must have at least one of each of the five different pieces to withstand a massive earthquake.<br>
      <br>
      The game board is a 22” x 22” square, an overhead map of the city with eight blocks along each of the four sides. Players who invest building material on a block receive a deed. Deeds are 2” x 2” cards, one for each block, 32 different names, with a color for the four quadrants of the city:<br>
      <br>
      Red - Southeast:<br>
      Johnson Creek, Woodstock, Foster, Division, Hawthorne, Belmont, Morrison, Water<br>
      <br>
      Blue - Northeast:<br>
      Sandy, Fremont, Alberta, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Lombard, Marine, Denver<br>
      <br>
      Yellow - Northwest:<br>
      Vaughn, Quimby, Pettygrove, Cornell, Overton, Lovejoy, Couch, Naito<br>
      <br>
      Green - Southwest:<br>
      Salmon, Corbett, Moody, Abernethy, Terwilliger, Barbur, Multnomah, Taylors Ferry<br>
      <br>
      The solid gray ground at the base of each block is bedrock, a foundation for your structures. Each corner of the game board is a season. All players start in time, in the winter, in the square called New Year. Written diagonally on the board from one corner to the center: You Will Win The Future - Build or Be Destroyed. In the center is a tank farm of noxious liquid.<br>
