Portland built a tank farm containing 90% of the state’s liquid fuel on dredge soil.

      <h2>Preparing for an Earthquake and the Threat of Predatory Finance</h2>
      <p>
      From the first settlers and for more than a hundred years,<br class="join-break">
      people building the neighborhoods of Portland<br class="join-break">
      didn’t know they were in earthquake country.<br class="join-break">
      And now,<br class="join-break">
      brick chimneys<br class="join-break">
      are a critical vulnerability for many homeowners.<br class="join-break">
      This could be an opportunity for a small business.<br class="join-break">
      And maybe the Portland Clean Energy Fund can be used<br class="join-break">
      to retrofit chimneys in low-income households,<br class="join-break">
      or to employ minority-owned businesses<br class="join-break">
      to reinforce every tall, narrow and hollow stack of unreinforced masonry<br class="join-break">
      in all the neighborhood homes. As a collective action, retrofitting brick chimneys<br class="join-break">
      throughout the city<br class="join-break">
      could help us all<br class="join-break">
      to consider how the shape of urban life<br class="join-break">
      might be restructured after the earthquake.<br class="join-break">
      <br>
      <br class="add-break">
      As we build resilience into our city,<br class="join-break">
      we can begin the transition to a low-carbon economy<br class="join-break">
      and since prior generations of urban planning and sunk investments<br class="join-break">
      prevent significant changes to the location of freeways and railroads,<br class="join-break">
      maybe we could ask what big changes<br class="join-break">
      to transportation, housing, and lifestyles,<br class="join-break">
      can happen after a massive earthquake,<br class="join-break">
      when so much of the city will be rebuilt?<br class="join-break">
      Can we begin to imagine a better city?<br class="join-break">
      <br>
      <br class="add-break">
      Portland needs everyone to realize its greatest potential.<br class="join-break">
      We can use participatory political processes to plan a city that will benefit all residents.<br class="join-break">
      People can improve upon the past.<br class="join-break">
      If we don’t plan for the city we want to live in,<br class="join-break">
      after people put out the fires,<br class="join-break">
      the only plan they have will be their memory of how Portland used to be<br class="join-break">
      and we have the photos, the city has been entirely documented—<br class="join-break">
      in our grief, in our need to get back to work, in honor of what was lost,<br class="join-break">
      what if the city is rapidly rebuilt exactly as it was?<br class="join-break">
      Modern construction methods and machines allow us to build an entire city, fast.<br class="join-break">
      Will the time after the quake be one of realizing a collective vision?<br class="join-break">
      Or maybe the disaster will be used to concentrate power and wealth by a few big players.<br class="join-break">
      <br><br>
      <br class="add-break">
      <h3>Interdependent lifelines and coming threats</h3><br>
      <p>Liquid fuel will be needed to power emergency vehicles and bulldozers,<br class="join-break">
      but our storage tanks are along the Willamette north of downtown, upon unstable ground.<br class="join-break">
      There’s a pipeline from Seattle but that’s not seismically resilient either.<br class="join-break">
      To clear the roads we need heavy machinery,<br class="join-break">
      but to transport fuel we need to repair pipelines and roads.<br class="join-break">
      All our critical lifelines are interdependent.<br class="join-break">
      And even if every resident has two weeks supply of emergency water,<br class="join-break">
      that won’t be enough.<br class="join-break">
      All the waterlines broken by a megathrust along the Cascade corridor<br class="join-break">
      won’t be repaired in two weeks time, much less the electric grid<br class="join-break">
      to power the pumping stations.<br class="join-break">
      It could be a year without water and sewer in Portland.<br class="join-break">
      <br>
      <br class="add-break">
      The Cascadia subduction zone earthquake will divide time between before and after:<br class="join-break">
      the post-earthquake city. When lifelines and routines have been disrupted for months—<br class="join-break">
      what if you didn’t work the job you currently have for six months or for as long as a year,<br class="join-break">
      if your employer or your own business is a casualty<br class="join-break">
      of the damage from the earthquake, fires, and economic disruption—<br class="join-break">
      people without savings could lose their homes. And if people can’t pay the rent,<br class="join-break">
      that property owner might default. If you work remote,<br class="join-break">
      when you get back online, what about your water?<br class="join-break">
      When an earthquake breaks apart roads, waterlines, power and sewage,<br class="join-break">
      with the downtown cordoned off,<br class="join-break">
      a no-go zone surrounding one-and-a-half times the height of buildings,<br class="join-break">
      the ability to make money suddenly shifts,<br class="join-break">
      combined with necessary repairs, say a brick chimney crashed through the roof,<br class="join-break">
      and the expense of making the mortgage may force many to walk away.<br class="join-break">
      <br>
      <br class="add-break">
      Earthquake codes only require the building to be survivable.<br class="join-break">
      If you are building beyond the minimum requirements, making structures<br class="join-break">
      that can still be used after a 9.0 subduction zone earthquake,<br class="join-break">
      you’re building for our region. You are building for a unique geology and climate.<br class="join-break">
      Resilience is a banner word for an environment deformed by global warming,<br class="join-break">
      when we have come to expect disruption. Building resilience is not for a niche market,<br class="join-break">
      it’s more than awesome marketing. Resilience in the built environment embodies<br class="join-break">
      our shared cultural awareness of multiple combined threats, tipping points,<br class="join-break">
      and cascading collapse. The loss of biodiversity, resource depletion,<br class="join-break">
      population pressure, and climate-driven migration. You know, in the years ahead,<br class="join-break">
      the water-rich region of the Pacific Northwest looks pretty good.<br class="join-break">
      <br><br>
      <br class="add-break">
      <h3>Speculative finance and imagined futures</h3><br>
      <p>In a disaster, people move fast. Money moves faster. Asset managers and algorithms<br class="join-break">
      buying and selling at the right moment. Sometime in the future, a warmer, drier planet<br class="join-break">
      makes this region even more desirable than it already is. It’s no secret.<br class="join-break">
      The money to buy homes, this land, will be available to a networked world of investors.<br class="join-break">
      These properties could be targeted by global finance. Water-rich regions of the world<br class="join-break">
      are already targets. And our farms, with their access to market on roadways disabled,<br class="join-break">
      could farmland of the Willamette Valley be vulnerable too?<br class="join-break">
      <br>
      <br class="add-break">
      Some people will leave by choice.<br class="join-break">
      When our toilets no longer flush,<br class="join-break">
      when trucks can’t deliver to our doorsteps,<br class="join-break">
      when everyone who came here for the doughnuts has long gone,<br class="join-break">
      the people who remain will live upon the land. They will remain for the land.<br class="join-break">
      For the love of this land. This place on earth. People will live here<br class="join-break">
      as they have lived in this place for thousands of years before us.<br class="join-break">
      They will repair and rebuild.<br class="join-break">
      If we are prepared, we will improve the city and have passed legislation<br class="join-break">
      to prevent predatory finance from capturing land in the Pacific Northwest,<br class="join-break">
      to prevent the financialization of our cities and way of life.<br class="join-break">
      <br>
      <br class="add-break">
      Can we, as a people,<br class="join-break">
      our representatives, the state,<br class="join-break">
      can we protect ourselves from disaster capitalism<br class="join-break">
      in a time of vulnerability? What is more powerful, global finance or the state?<br class="join-break">
      <br>
      <br class="add-break">
      Now it is only speculation,<br class="join-break">
      a novel about financial technology, <cite class="italic">You Will Win The Future</cite><br class="join-break">
      follows an eccentric group of people, each embody different ideas, powerful ideas<br class="join-break">
      about themselves and their world that can so fully capture one, and these ideas are fixated<br class="join-break">
      upon our world, the Pacific Northwest, Portland’s future. The story is set in the near-future,<br class="join-break">
      the trends carrying forward our consensual reality.<br class="join-break">
      An exploration, with science as its foundation, this book is an exploration<br class="join-break">
      of an unknown future in which we have only the past, our present.<br class="join-break">
      A massive amount of data we can project along trendlines into the future.<br class="join-break">
      <br>
      <br class="add-break">
      Please read this book. Paperbacks are available for purchase now,<br class="join-break">
      and anyone can sign up for my newsletter and receive the ebook for free today.<br class="join-break">
      Thank you for giving this a moment of your time<br class="join-break">
      and may it be a fruitful endeavor of your continued inquiry and industry<br class="join-break">
      as the builders and visionaries of our future city.<br class="join-break">
