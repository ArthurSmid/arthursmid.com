  <h2>Communications Specialist in Portland, Oregon</h2>

<article class="about">
<p>
I work with individuals and organizations to improve their written and spoken communication. Whether you are a small organization producing a regular newsletter or an individual sending out cover letters to land a job with a nonprofit, I can help you to achieve your goals. I moved to Portland in 2000 and have worked in graphic design, illustration, photography, video production, and journalism. But most of all, I am a listener. The discovery of ideas and insights, the experience of new perspectives is the foundation of my work.<br>
<br>In 2019, I published a novel about participatory political processes. The research and writing furthered my understanding of Oregon and my book received a number of endorsements, including one from Reed College professor and author Peter Rock. After completing the manuscript, I began volunteering with Code for America. At the local chapter, I develop relationships with government and community partners, as well as sponsors for our project nights. My contribution to Code for PDX requires attending events, meeting people, and nurturing relationships. I am also responsible for outreach through email and social media.<br> 
<br>I have long worked as an independent contractor and with a community of writers, listening to their advice and helping each other to improve. Please contact me for a free consultation—we can schedule time for a call or to meet in person. Let's talk about your project and how I might be of service.<br>
